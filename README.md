# nifi-contrib-assembly

Demo project to show devops teams how they can automate fetching NiFi optional packages.

Run it with `mvn install` to generate a zip file in the `target/` folder. That zip file will contain all of the 
itemized optional NAR dependencies listed in the `<dependencies/>` block.
